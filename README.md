This project develops a multi-modal machine learning model to improve dietary intake monitoring for individuals with diabetes. It integrates three datasets: time-series data from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), health and demographic information, and meal images. The model includes three components: an image model using a pre-trained ResNet-50 to extract features from meal images, an LSTM-based model to capture temporal patterns in CGM data, and a fully connected neural network for health data. These components are combined into a multi-modal calorie predictor. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated with a testing Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE) of 0.34, showing a significant improvement of 0.18 over the benchmark. This approach automates dietary intake tracking, helping manage blood sugar levels and prevent cardiovascular diseases in diabetic individuals.
